        <p>
          We present a deep learning approach for predicting absolute GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) from single monocular images of a university campus. 
          The task is formulated as a regression problem, mapping visual features directly to geographic coordinates. 
          We address key challenges including limited training data, extreme lighting variations (day vs. night), and visual ambiguity in repetitive architectural structures. 
          Our proposed method utilizes a <strong>ConvNeXt-Tiny ensemble</strong> with a custom MLP regression head, trained using a robust Huber Loss and a novel 
          <strong>"Night Simulation"</strong> augmentation strategy. We further employ an <strong>Active Learning</strong> loop to identify and incorporate 
          "blind spot" locations into the training set. Our final ensemble model achieves a Mean Distance Error (MDE) of <strong>7.16 meters</strong> 
          and a Median Error of 6.48 meters on a held-out test set, significantly outperforming ResNet and EfficientNet baselines and approaching the theoretical limit of consumer GPS accuracy.

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="./static/images/architecture.png" alt="Model Architecture">
        <div class="caption">
          Figure 2: <strong>System Architecture.</strong> We adopt a regression-based approach. The backbone (ConvNeXt-Tiny) extracts a 768-dimensional feature vector, 
          which is processed by a custom MLP head (Linear → GELU → Dropout → Linear) to predict Cartesian coordinates (x, y) relative to a campus reference point.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Architecture:</strong> We chose ConvNeXt-Tiny for its large 7x7 kernels, which capture wider spatial context than standard CNNs (like EfficientNet's 3x3 kernels). 
        This is crucial for distinguishing similar-looking corridors by recognizing distant landmarks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Loss Function:</strong> We minimize Huber Loss (δ=1.0) instead of MSE. This makes training robust to outliers caused by noisy GPS labels (phone GPS drift), 
        preventing the model from overfitting to "bad" ground truth.

      <h3>1. Night Simulation</h3>
      <p>
        Night images initially accounted for 48% of our worst failures. We developed a tuned "Night Simulation" augmentation that randomly adjusts brightness (40-70%) 
        and contrast to simulate low-light conditions without destroying structural information. This reduced catastrophic night failures (>50m error) by over 90%.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Active Learning Loop</h3>
      <p>
        We employed an iterative "human-in-the-loop" strategy. After training an initial model, we identified test samples with high error (>30m), labeled them as "Problematic Photos," 
        and moved them to the training set. This effectively targeted the model's "blind spots" (e.g., specific unrepresented viewing angles).
      </p>

      <h3>3. Manual GPS Correction</h3>
      <p>
        We visually audited the 40 worst predictions and found that in 60% of cases, the model was actually <em>correct</em> and the ground truth GPS was drifted. 
        We manually corrected these labels using satellite imagery, revealing the true performance of our model.
