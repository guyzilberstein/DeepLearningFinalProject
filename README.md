# DeepLearningFinalProject
This project involves training a neural network to regress GPS coordinates from single campus images. Using smartphone EXIF data for ground truth, you will map visual scenes to latitude and longitude for localization. The goal is to minimize distance error in meters while ensuring robustness to lighting and dynamic objects.
